# Blender Hub

This app is a home-grown, personal project and is not associated with the Blender team (Blender Foundation and Blender Institute) in any way.

This app can be used to:
- Install new versions of Blender. It fetches a catalogue from the internet for differnet categories like Daily Builds, Experimental Builds, etc. and presents them in the app. It fetches the catalogues from the [Daily Builds](https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/) webpage and [Branch Builds](https://builder.blender.org/download/experimental/) webpage for Daily and Experimental builds respectively.
- (Coming Soon) A project manager built within the app where you can assign a folder as a blender project and track your assets/scenes and many other stuff directly from the app.

This project currently only supports Windows (x64)
